# *Tutorial*

Honestly, the fastest way to check the functionality here is to run the tests since they test all the important needed functionality. But I have also included a demo program that checks if a given sequence is in the tree. Before compiling *trees_demo*, you can fiddle a little bit with the values in the *demo.cpp* and then compile and run the program to see the output.

To check the difference between my implementation and some other implementation run and compile *compare_trees*. It will give as an output times of the run-time of given functions.
